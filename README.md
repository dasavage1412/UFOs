# Summary
The new design shows to much cluttered data on the main page. This makes the whole page look unorganinzed.

# Improvement 1 
 Hide the data until a filer request is made. If not filter request is made then just show the entire dataset
 
 # Improvment 2 
  Get more data and make it up to date. The dataset seems limited. With more data we could create a map that shows sighting with population bubbles.
